	<h1>DTS2AC3</h1>
	<p>This GUI application is designed to convert DTS audio tracks within MKV files into AC3 audio tracks by utilizing the FFmpeg library. However, it is important to note that this program is not fully developed and may not function properly. Currently, the main problem to address is that the conversion process continues even after the program has been terminated, and there is no option to cancel the conversion yet.</p>
